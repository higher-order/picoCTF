# Solution
1. Download the flag file. Assuming it's downloaded to `/home/user/Downloads/flag`.
2. Change working directory to `/home/user/Downloads` by running `cd ~/Downloads`
3. Run `cat flag`.

To learn more about `cat`, run `cat --help`, or `man cat`.

To learn more about most of the other Linux commands, run `man <command>`. Substitute \<command\> with the actual command name.

Or simply look up on search engines.
