# Solution
1. Download the flag file. Change working directory (using `cd`) to the directory of the downloaded file.
2. Run `cat flag`

To learn more about `cat`, run `cat --help`, or `man cat`.

To learn more about most of the other Linux commands, run `man <command>`. Substitute \<command\> with the actual command name.

Or simply look up on search engines.
